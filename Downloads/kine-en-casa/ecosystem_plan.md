# KINE PRIVÉ: Premium Kinesiology Ecosystem - Implementation Plan

## Vision
To position KineEnCasa as the undisputed leader in home kinesiology in Santiago by integrating advanced technology (AI), premium physical service (Kits, Scent), and a digital patient experience.

## 1. Technical Architecture (The "Stack")

We will leverage the suggested low-code/high-impact stack but integrated tightly into your Next.js application for a seamless brand experience.

| Feature | Recommended Tech | Integration Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web / Landing** | **Next.js + Tailwind** (Current) | Hosting the marketing site and "Portal" shell. |
| **Patient Portal** | **Supabase** (Auth + DB) | Users log in at `app.kineencasa.cl` to view plans/progress. |
| **AI Assistant** | **n8n + OpenAI + WhatsApp API** | The primary interface. The "brain" that feeds data to Supabase. |
| **Exercises** | **Custom Video Library** | Hosted on YouTube/Vimeo (Private), embedded in Portal/WhatsApp. |
| **Payments** | **Stripe** | For recurring "Membership" billing (Essential/Premium). |

## 2. Product Roadmap

### Phase 1: The "Promise" (Landing Page & Sales Structure)
*Goal: Sell the vision before building all the plumbing.*
- [ ] **Rebrand Plans**: Update `page.tsx` pricing section to "Essential, Premium, Elite".
- [ ] **Ecosystem Showcase**: Add a new section dealing with "The Kine Privé Experience" (AI, Portal, Kit).
- [ ] **Lead Capture**: "Join the Waitlist" or "Apply for Membership" for the Elite plan (scarcity).

### Phase 2: The "MVP" Ecosystem
*Goal: Deliver the core digital value.*
- [ ] **WhatsApp AI Bot**: Setup n8n workflow to handle basic Triage and FAQ.
- [ ] **Digital Evaluation**: Create a standardized PDF report template that looks "generated by AI" but is manually curated by the Kine initially.
- [ ] **Exercise Playlist**: Curate the top 10 conditions into Notion pages or Unlisted YouTube playlists.

### Phase 3: The "Full Suite"
*Goal: Automation and Scale.*
- [ ] **Patient Portal**: Build the `/login` area where patients see their graphs.
- [ ] **IoT Integration**: Integrate simple data inputs (e.g. photos of posture) into the patient record.

## 3. Complementary Suggestions (The "Antigravity" Boost)

To truly differentiate, we suggest these additions to your plan:

### A. The "Neuromuscular Signature" (Brand Identity)
Instead of just "Kine Privé", brand the *methodology*.
*   *"Metodo KineZero"* or *"NeuroMotion Protocols"*.
*   Sell the *method*, not just the service.

### B. "Smart" Home Kit (Hardware)
Include a simple **Bluetooth measurement tool** (even a cheap smart scale or grip strength tester) in the Elite kit.
*   *Why?* Data is sticky. If they see their "Strength Score" go up in the app, they won't leave.

### C. Family Account
Allow the "Elite" membership to cover the household (e.g., Mom gets back pain relief, Dad gets preventative mobility).

## 4. Immediate Action Item: Landing Page Transformation
We will update `page.tsx` to reflect this new premium positioning immediately.

**Proposed Changes to `app/page.tsx`:**
1.  **Hero Section Update**: Emphasize "AI-Powered" and "Premium Ecosystem".
2.  **New "Ecosystem" Section**: Visual cards explaining the AI, the Kit, and the Portal.
3.  **Pricing Table Overhaul**: Switch to the Monthly Membership model (Essential/Premium/Elite).
